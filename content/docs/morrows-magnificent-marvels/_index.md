# Morrow's Magnificent Marvels

In my long centuries of travels, I have run into a great many wondrous creatures, treasures, and locales, though it wasn't until I joined The Grim Saints and began my adventure with them that I started recording what I had encountered.

What I've encountered since that time, however, is recorded here, because I can't _not_ share them. Hopefully, you see the same wonder in them that I have.
