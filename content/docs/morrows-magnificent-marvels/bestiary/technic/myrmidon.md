# Technic Myrmidon

{{< columns >}}

Resembling a flying humanoid, even the aberrant Myrmidon can be a formidable foe. Its laser tentacles can paralyze its target, leaving the victim vulnerable to other attacks.

When fully functional, the Myrmidon is no laughing matter. As intelligent as most humanoids, with the power to create a force shield for extra protection, and to lash out with its tentacles or generate an electrical pulse to hit enemies at range, the Myrmidon can pose a real threat to anyone who stumbles upon one.

While considered "Technic" by most people, Myrmidons are not, in fact, under the control of the Technic League. The Myrmidon's artificial intelligence has proven too advanced for the League to bend to their will, allowing the machines to act and live of their own accord.

## Variant: Aberrant Myrmidon

Aberrant Myrmidons have malfunctioned for one reason or another, often as a result of a spacial anomaly or electromagnetic interference. These Myrmidons cannot generate sufficient power to generate a force field, use its stronger attacks, or generate as much pincer force. Their artificial brain has also partially shut down, rendering them unable to understand language or communicate in any meaningful way.

That doesn't mean they are easy to dispatch, however. They are still strong machines, capable of both grappling and flight, and their tentacles can still stun their victims -- a potentially deadly combination.

>
> ***Flyby.*** The myrmidon's flight speed allows it to move out of range of enemies without provoking an attack of opportunity.
>
> ***Sense Magic.*** The myrmidon senses magic within 120 feet of it at will. This trait works like the *Detect Magic* spell, but isn't itself magical.
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The myrmidon makes two attacks with any combination of pincers or tentacles. If it is grappling a creature, it can also use its tentacles to attempt to paralyze a creature.
>
> ***Force Shield.*** The myrmidon generates a force shield, granting it 10d10 temporary hit points. The shield takes all incoming damage until it is brought to 0 or is disrupted. If the shield suffers lightning damage, the myrmidon must make a DC 12 constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the shield is disrupted and all remaining temporary hit points are lost.
> ### Actions
> ***Pincer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft, one target. *Hit* 15 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage
>
> The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the myrmidon doesn't have two other creatures grappled.
>
> ***Tentacle Lash.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 20 ft, one target. *Hit* 18 (3d8 + 4) lightning damage
>
> ***Tentacle Paralysis.*** One creature grappled by the myrmidon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
>
> ***Laser Rifle.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 80/320, one target. *Hit* 32 (5d10 + 4) lightning damage. Recharge 4-6
>
> For its attack, the myrmidon may choose to fire a beam of electricity from its eye. The power required to make this attack prevents it from taking other attack actions this round and requires some time to recharge between uses.
