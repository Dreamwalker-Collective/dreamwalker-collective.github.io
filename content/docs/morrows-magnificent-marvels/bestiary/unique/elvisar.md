# Elvisar

{{< columns >}}

One of the leading bards at the school in Castle Urion, he served as my bard tutor and loose ally while I was there.

He's a little flamboyant (okay, a lot flamboyant), has a cocky streak, and gives truth to the bard stereotype, but behind the act, does genuinely care about those he calls friend.
