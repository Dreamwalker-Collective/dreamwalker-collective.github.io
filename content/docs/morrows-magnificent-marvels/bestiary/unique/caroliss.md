# Caroliss Minerran

{{< columns >}}

Commander Caroliss Minerran leads the Iomedaean knights that rule the settlement of Castle Urion in Numeria. As such, she balances her oath to Iomedae, her deal with the Black Sovereign, and her own morals.

We ran into her when a vampire hunter came after me (long story), and it was her oath tenets of honor and compassion that saved us...until one of my guys caused trouble at the inn later that evening (uh...also a long story).
