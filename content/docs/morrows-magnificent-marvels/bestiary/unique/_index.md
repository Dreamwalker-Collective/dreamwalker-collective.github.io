# Unique Creatures and Notable People

Ferocious beasts and hordes of monsters are not the only things we've encountered in our travels. We've also had the honor of meeting a number of notable, interesting people, and earned glory through fighting creatures seen nowhere else.

## Editor's Note

While the stat blocks in this section follow the NPC format, most of the characters in this section are intended for, or can be used with, full character sheets. Likewise, they can easily be scaled up or down as needed, just as one would with a player character.
