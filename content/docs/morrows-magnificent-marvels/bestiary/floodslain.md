# The Floodslain

{{< columns >}}

From *Belkzen, Hold of the Orc Hordes*:

> Collectively known as “the after-storm” by Belkzen natives, floodslain are victims of flash floods that have risen as undead. They’re creatures of panic and despair, driven by anger, fear, and a yearning to drag others into the waters. Long after the floodwaters recede, floodslain continue spreading the miserable death that claimed them.
> Floodslain are similar in appearance to their original living forms, and are recognizable even in their waterlogged state. Many were gruesomely damaged by the floods that took their lives, though, their bodies battered and broken by rushing water and debris. The one feature common among all floodslain is wild, panicked eyes—a telltale sign of a death mired in shock and fear. Floodslain tend to drift toward lower ground, as if seeking the very water that transformed them. While this habitual migration makes them a contained threat in some areas, the relatively flat floodplains of Belkzen offer little resistance to the wandering undead. They can be found floating in major rivers, trapped in ravines and valleys, and staggering across flatlands, sometimes in large numbers. Floodslain that come close to living creatures try to drown them, and relentlessly follow those who flee. Targets who escape often draw the attention of yet more floodslain, eventually leading the undead to their homes. In great numbers, floodslain can slaughter small settlements.
> 
> While many find the possibility of undead born from purely natural disasters to be disturbing in and of itself, theories from druids and scholars in Lastwall hold even more chilling implications. Given that floodslain are most common in eastern Belkzen yet are little known outside that region, it is suspected that the floodwater itself was cursed even before falling as snow, perhaps by the dark influence of Gallowspire. If the Whispering Tyrant’s insidious reach could extend so far using only passing clouds, the crusaders of Lastwall might be facing a threat even more dire than they realize.
