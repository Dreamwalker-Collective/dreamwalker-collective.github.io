# Iomedaean Knight

{{< columns >}}

The Iomedaean Knights serve as the guard and ruling class of Castle Urion in southwestern Numeria. As Knights of Iomedae, they embody the typical "knight in shining armor" ideal. Their steel plate and (typically) greatsword are crafted to appear nearly white, save for their red gold accents, and kept highly polished.

## Variant: Defensive

Defensive Knights forego the greatsword of most knights in favor of the more stereotypical longsword and shield, granting them additional protection at the expense of a little damage output. These Knights will gladly put themselves between the enemy and their less-armored allies.

## Variant: Knight-Captain

While all of the Knights are considered paladins, only the Knight-Captain is a "true" Paladin, possessing the abilities Divine Sense and Lay on Hands. A Knight-Captain has earned sufficient favor from the goddess and is seen as fit to oversee a unit.

<strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The standard ("offensive") Iomedaean Knight is simply the Knight NPC found on page 347 of the Monster Manual, which is why it is not listed here.

> ***Divine Sense.*** As an action, the Knight-Captain can open their awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of their next turn, they know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of them that is not behind total cover. The Knight-Captain knows the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence they sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, they also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

> ***Lay On Hands.*** The Knight-Captain has a pool of healing power allowing them to heal wounds. This ability can be used up to 5 times, and replenishes after a long rest.
>
> As an action, the Knight-Captain can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.
>
> This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
> ### Reactions
> ***Parry.*** The knight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
