# Iomedaean Gryphon Rider

{{< columns >}}

Sporting lighter armor than their ground counterparts, the Gryphon Riders of Castle Urion are mounted Knights serving as air support and long-range patrol of the castle and River Road.

Gryphons, however, are not mere steeds. As part of their training, Gryphon Riders must take an egg and incubate it as the Gryphon parents would, so that the hatchling imprints on the rider. The Gryphon remains loyal to the rider throughout their shared life, creating the deep bond and ability to act as a single unit that is required to perform the aerial acrobatics the Riders are known for.
