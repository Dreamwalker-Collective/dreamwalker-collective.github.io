# The Floodslain

{{< columns >}}

<div class="phb">

> We saw the stream of water, first. It flowed down the hill, bringing the leaves with it and turning everything to thick, soupy, slippery mud.
> 
> But it was the eyes that were most chilling. The orc was wild-eyed, as if frozen in fear, as were the rectangular eyes of his goats. And they were all dripping wet, as though caught in an invisible downpour so perpetual that their bodies took on the water like over-saturated rags, swelling them grotesquely and flowing from their eyes, their noses...their wounds.
> 
> Their gait was painful even to watch, as they walked on mangled legs, and as they got closer, we could see chunks of flesh missing, exposing whole sections of bone. And still they came. We did what any sane person would.
> 
> We ran.
> 
> And yet, still they followed. Night and day. Relentlessly. When we dared look back, more had joined them. We thought we'd die from exhaustion before finding safe refuge...and maybe even someone to help us.

The orcs call them "the After-Storm." The human traders refer to them as "Floodslain." Regardless of what they're called, they're hands-down *the* biggest threat on the way to the Flood Truce. Even the flying creatures are wary of them and avoid their path.

These undead -- usually orcs, half-orcs, or humans, but sometimes other land or air creatures who had the misfortune of getting caught in a flood (either of water, or of Floodslain) -- are relentless even by undead standards. Not bound to one place and tending to group and "flow" like the waters that took their lives, they can travel for hundreds of miles across Belkzen's plains and along the swollen spring waterways, and will do so in pursuit of whatever living creature it sets fear-stricken eyes on.

And while they look, more or less, like they did while living (except waterlogged and a little worse for wear), they've lost all semblance of their former selves and know only one thing -- seek out the living and destroy them, drowning their victims and forcing them to join in their watery hell.

Misery really does love company.

The scholars believe that the Floodslain are created, because the waters nearest the Gallowspire and Lastwall are corrupted by the Whispering Tyrant's magic. All the more reason he needs destroyed once and for all, if you ask me.

## Creating Floodslain Creatures

Floodslain, like [the Blessed Cultists]({{< relref "blessed-cultists.md" >}} "Blessed Cultists"), is a template that can be applied to existing creatures. When applied, a Floodslain creature changes in the following ways:

- **Challenge Rating:** Base Creature + 2
- **Type:** Undead
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Evil
- **Languages:** Understands the languages it knew in life, but can no longer speak
- **Speed:** Gains 30ft swim speed if it did not already have a swim speed
- **Armor:** +1 armor
- **Damage Resistances:** Cold
- **Damage Immunities:** Poison (undead)
- **Condition Immunities:** Poisoned (undead)
- **Attribute Changes:** The following changes are applied to the base stats, modifiers adjusted accordingly:
  - Strength: +2
  - Dexterity: -2
  - Constitution: +2
  - Intelligence: Max 6
- **Attack:** In addition to attacks it knew in life, the Floodslain gains a Slam attack with the following damage based on size:
  - Tiny: 1d4+str
  - Small: 2d4+str
  - Medium: 2d6+str
  - Large: 2d8+str
  - Huge: 3d8+str
  - Gargantuan: 3d10+str

<div class="note wide left">
Of course, the creature losing its weapons is an option, too.
</div>

- **Multiattack:** If the base creature has multiattack, it can use it *only* with the attacks it had in life (as described by the base creature's stat block), *or* it can choose to make *one* Slam attack (it cannot do both Slam and multiattack).

<div class="note wide">

#### Optional: Magic Damage Types

If a creature had magic while it was living, sometimes it makes sense to change its type when it becomes undead. A fire-wielding creature may now cause cold damage, or radiant may become necrotic.

</div>

- **Drowning Touch:** The slam attack of a Floodslain creature partially fills a living victim's lungs with water. The victim must succeed in a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + the Floodslain's Constitution) or begin to drown and is slowed. The creature must repeat the save at the end of each of its next turns. On a failed save, the slowed creature becomes incapacitated, and the incapacitated creature falls unconscious and begins dying. Creatures that do not need to breathe are immune to this effect.
- **Create Spawn:** Creatures killed by the Floodslain's Drowning Touch, or killed by the Floodslain and left submerged in water, will rise as Floodslain after 24 hours.

<div class="note left wide">

#### Optional: Make It Rain

Water continues to stream even from flying creatures, making the area directly under them lightly obscured with the same effect as heavy rain.

</div>

- **Flash Flood:** A Floodslain creature is constantly surrounded by an echo of the disaster that originally took its life. Water streams from its body, forming a 10-foot radius pool that renders the ground slick and muddy, making it difficult terrain.
- **Frightful Gaze:** The dead eyes of a Floodslain creature are frozen in shock and fear. As an action, the Floodslain can turn this gaze onto a target. The target must then make a Wisdom save (DC 10 + the Floodslain's Constitution) or be frightened. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this Floodslain's Frightful Gaze for 24 hours.
