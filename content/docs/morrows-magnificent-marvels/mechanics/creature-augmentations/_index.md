# Creature Augmentations

Magic runs rampant across Golarion. Between the proximity to other planes, the experiments of the Technic League, the machinations of gods, and the random mages that decide to fuck around with the arcane arts, all kinds of anomalies can happen. While they might create entirely new creatures when they do, far more often do other creatures get caught in the wake and end up changed in some way.

## Editor's Notes

This section does not include creatures in the strictest sense, but rather formulaic alterations that can be made to existing creatures (often referred to as "templates").

Additionally, this content, largely by its nature, is experimental and still needs more testing. Consider the creature statblocks to be suggestions or examples of the template in action.
