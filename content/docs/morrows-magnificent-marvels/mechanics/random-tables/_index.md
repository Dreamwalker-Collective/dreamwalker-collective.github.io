# Random Tables

The wilds of Golarion contain a great many things, and each place is different. Some are threatening, some are friendly, and some...well...some you should just run away from as fast as your legs will carry you.

## Editor's Notes

Minimum levels in an encounter table's info mean that most of the table provides a deadly challenge for a group of 5 characters of that level. It also assumes at least one is a durable "tank" type of character that can withstand a hit or two.
