# The Sarkorian Steppes

- **Environment:** Steppe, Flatland
- **Climate:** Arctic/Subarctic
- **Minimum Level:** 6

The Sarkorian Steppes, in the westernmost region of the Worldwound, contains a fascinating assortment of creatures, due to its position as a borderland between the heart of the Worldwound and the unaffected Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Travelers through the region may see nothing but the native mammoths, elks, or even powerful rocs, while others, even following the same road, may run into any number of the demons that roam the area.
