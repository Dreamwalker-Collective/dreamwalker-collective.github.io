The curse of lycanthropy doesn't take over immediately; a full moon is needed to cement its hold over a person. Until then, a potion made of Wolf's Bane can be used to cure the person -- but the cure comes with risks of its own.

The potion that can cure early stage lycanthropy is volatile and must be made from the highly toxic Wolf's Bane flower, must be administered before the afflicted's first full moon, and the potion is only good for one to two weeks (and therefore cannot be made ahead of time and stockpiled indefinitely).

Go ahead, ask me how I know all this.

## Obtaining Wolf's Bane Flowers

<div class="note">
In some locations, Wolf's Bane only grows during certain times of the year, which can make finding the flowers easier or more difficult.

Obtaining the key ingredient is, itself, a bit of a tricky process. It grows along forest edges, as an herbaceous, mounding plant under larger bushes. Each plant bears only a handful of flowers at any given time, though sometimes one can get lucky and find more than usual, or even a second plant in the same location. The ideal flowers are deep purple, but the plant can bear colors ranging from pale to medium yellow and any shade of purple. Any of the lighter colors are more toxic than the deep purple, without any additional potency against the curse, and while a potion can still be made with them, they should be avoided by all but the most durable of party members, and even still, used only if absolutely necessary.

Additionally, between the highly toxic nature of the plants, and the time it takes to find, identify, and harvest the flowers, no more than three rounds of gathering can happen per day, and if the group must move to a new search area, that uses the time for a round of gathering, leaving the group with just two rounds.

### Locating, Identifying, and Harvesting

A successful gathering round consists of three steps, each with their own skill check:

1. Find a candidate bush to look under (Perception)
2. Find the plant and its flowers (Investigation)
3. Identify and harvest the flowers (Nature)

The DC for the skill checks start at 10 + the searcher's skill bonus. Different characters can be used for each task, and if the characters are given a reference drawing of the flower, or other identification information, the Nature check DC can be reduced by 2.



- For every 2 correct identifications, Nature DC reduces by 1
- For every 4 correct identifications, Perception DC reduces by 1
- Investigation in a new area starts at 17
  - For every 3 successes in the same area, DC increases by 1
  - For every 4 successes overall, starting DC for a new area decreases by 1

Failed Nature checks still yield flowers, but unusable (DC minus 6+) or yellow ones (DC minus 1-5). Yellow flowers can still be used to make a potion, but death save DC increases by 1 for every 2 yellow flowers used.

Maximum 3 checks per day. Each successful round yields 1d4 flowers.

10 flowers per potion
