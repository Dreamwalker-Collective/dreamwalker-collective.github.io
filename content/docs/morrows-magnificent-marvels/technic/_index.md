# Technic Constructs

Numeria is a strange land, filled with futuristic constructs from a distant world. Equally strange is the fact that these constructs stay almost exclusively in Numeria.

Technic constructs typically consist at least partially of nanotech -- tiny nanobots that grant the construct the ability to change shape, heal, climb, and more. Some, like the Spiderbots, are comprised entirely of nanobots, and disintegrate when destroyed.

## Artificial Intelligence

While not sentient in the way we understand the concept, most Technic Constructs possess an artificial, neuronet "brain" on some level or another. This gives them the potential to understand language and the need for a sort of periodic rest cycle.

While this artificial brain allows for the possibility of communication even on a psychic level, the structure is sufficiently different that psychic *damage* does not affect them as much as it would their organic counterparts.
