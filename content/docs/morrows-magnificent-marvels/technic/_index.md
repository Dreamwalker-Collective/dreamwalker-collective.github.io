Numeria is a strange land, filled with futuristic constructs from a distant world. Equally strange is the fact that these constructs stay almost exclusively in Numeria.

Technic constructs typically consist at least partially of nanotech -- tiny nanobots that grant the construct the ability to change shape, heal, climb, and more. Some, like the Spiderbots, are comprised entirely of nanobots, and disintegrate when destroyed.
