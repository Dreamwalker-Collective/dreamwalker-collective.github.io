# Technic Hydra

{{< columns >}}

Like their organic counterparts, Technic Hydras have multiple heads that regrow when severed. Instead of fire, though, these creatures need a lightning attack to disrupt their nanotech and prevent regrowth.

Similar to the Myrmidons, the Hydra has the ability to focus its electrical energy into a single beam of lightning, though the Hydra's is powerful enough to paralyze at range. The general consensus of those who study this creature (and live to tell about it) is that it uses this ability to aid in hunting and bringing down prey.

> ***Multiple Heads.*** The hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.

>
> At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken lightning damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.
>
> ***Reactive Heads.*** For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.
>
> ***Wakeful.*** While the hydra rests, at least one of its heads is awake.
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The hydra makes as many bite attacks as it has heads.

>
> The hydra can use one of its attacks to lash out at an enemy with a bolt of lightning.
