# Technic Collector Bot

{{< columns >}}

Collector Bots are designed for one purpose -- collect and study *everything*. These peaceful constructs don't pose much of a mortal threat, since its stun gun is used solely to incapacitate a target, the only potentially lethal part is its claw slam, and even that would be accidental unless the bot is malfunctioning.

When it comes to living creatures, the bot's primary directive is "catch, tag, and release," using its claw slam to catch its target so that it can inject a tracking chip under the skin, then release it to observe and record its behaviors, and finally catch it later for additional study.
