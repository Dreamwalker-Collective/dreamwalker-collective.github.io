# Technic Spiderbot

{{< columns >}}

More annoying than dangerous to anyone who has grown beyond a commoner, unless they swarm. And swarm they do. Spiderbots generally appear in packs of no less than four.

These creatures are about the size of a large dog, with a body resembling a scorpion. Pincers on the front lash out to attack those in melee, while the spiked tail can either lash out in a melee attack, or open up to reveal small laser guns to hit targets at range. In either configuration, the spiderbot can hit with three attacks per turn.

What makes these different from other, larger Technic constructs is that they are comprised entirely of nanobots, making them adept at climbing and leaving nothing behind when they die.
